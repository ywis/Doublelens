Dear Prof. Stinebring,

Thanks for the careful review. We have made modifications according to your comments.

* Introduction to secondary spectrum analysis is added to the last paragraph in page 3 with the required references added. Hill et al. (2003) which gives reference for the radio scaling is also added to the following content of equation 1.

* We clarify the statement about odd image theorem and the number of images in the second paragraph in Section 3, specifically from 2 images to 2 additional images.

* Typos fixed.


Best regards,

Siqi, Ue-Li, JP, Walter, Adam
