Dear Editor,

Thanks for coordinating and careful editing. We have made modifications according to Prof. Stinebring's comments as follows:

* Introduction to secondary spectrum analysis is added to the last paragraph in page 3 with the required references added. Hill et al. (2003) which gives reference for the radio scaling is also added to the following content of equation 1.

* We clarify the statement about odd image theorem and the number of images in the second paragraph in Section 3. The total number of the images is odd, the saying of "two images" is modified into "two additional images".

* Typos fixed.


Best regards,

Siqi, Ue-Li, JP, Walter, Adam
